    <p>What if sorting apartments on online rental websites were based on how quick the landlords or realtors respond?</p>
    <div class="boxt"><br>
      <p>The concept involves rethinking about sorting methods based on reatlor's responses in online real estate portals, so that the interaction between the users and landlords are more straightforward. This would not leave false hopes to the clients and allow them to make terms with the reality. <br><br> My narrative focuses on how realtors sometimes take all the time in the world to respond to an inquiry. The objective was to make this narrative sarcastic and comical, which influenced everything starting from the tone to the usernames in the narrative. Also, I made sure the form has to go with the content I’m posting. For instance, social media platforms like twitter have been a space of virtual conflict and outlet for people’s frustration. Having searched for apartments back in August, I knew the way realtors communicate, the platforms they use, which turned out to be pivotal in building the narrative in a more believable way. </p>
