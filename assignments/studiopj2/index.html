    <p class="bold-text">FADE IN: <br><br> EXT. 8TH STREET—LATE AFTERNOON (C. 1959)</p>

    </p> CAMERA IN NONSTOP MOTION is on the shoulder of a young man, late teens, intently walking west on a busy Greenwich Village thoroughfare. Under one arm, he’s carrying books. In his other hand, a copy of The Village Voice. </p>
    <p> He walks quickly, past men in coats and hats, women with scarves over their heads pushing collapsible shopping carts, couples holding hands, and poets and hustlers and musicians and winos, past drugstores, liquor stores, delis, apartment buildings. But the young man is zeroed in on one thing: the marquee of the Art Theatre, which is playing John Cassavetes’s Shadows and Claude Chabrol’s Les Cousins. </p>

    <p class="queue-text">DISSOLVE TO:</p><br><br>
    
    <p class="bold-text">EXT. FIFTH AVENUE-LATE AFTERNOON </p>
    <p>He makes a mental note and then crosses Fifth Avenue and keeps walking west, past bookstores and record shops and recording studios and shoe stores, until he gets to the 8th Street Playhouse: The Cranes Are Flying and Hiroshima Mon Amour, and Jean-Luc Godard’s Breathless is coming soon! <br><br>We stay on him as he turns left on Sixth Avenue and hustles his way past diners and more liquor stores and newsstands and a cigar store and crosses the street to get a good look at the Waverly marquee—Ashes and Diamonds. </p>
        
    <p class="queue-text">DISSOLVE TO:</p><br><br>

    <p class="bold-text">EXT. WEST 4TH - LATE AFTERNOON </p>
    <p>He walks past Kettle of Fish and Judson Memorial Church on Washington Square South, where a man in a threadbare suit is handing out leaflets: Anita Ekberg in furs, and La Dolce Vita is opening at a legitimate theater on Broadway, with reserved seats for sale at Broadway ticket prices! <br><br>He walks down LaGuardia Place to Bleecker, past the Village Gate and the Bitter End to the Bleecker Street Cinema, which is showing Through a Glass Darkly, Shoot the Piano Player, and Love at Twenty—and La Notte is held over for a third straight month! </p>
    
    <p class="queue-text">CUT TO:</p><br><br>

    <p class="bold-text">EXT. THE CINEMA - LATER AFTERNOON</p>
    <p> He gets in line for the Truffaut movie and opens his copy of the Voice to the Film section and a cornucopia of riches jumps from the pages and swirls around him — Winter Light, Pickpocket, The Third Lover, The Hand in the Trap, Andy Warhol screenings, Pigs and Battleships, Kenneth Anger and Stan Brakhage at Anthology Film Archives, Le Doulos, and in the midst of it all, looming larger than the rest: Joseph E. Levine presents Federico Fellini’s 8½! <br><br>As he pores over the pages, the CAMERA RISES ABOVE HIM and the waiting crowd, as if on the waves of their excitement.</p>

    <p class="bold-text">FADE OUT.</p>
